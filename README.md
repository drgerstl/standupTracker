# Who's Left?
 
Who's Left? is a tracking app for stand-ups. For those times when you can't remember who is yet to go. It allows you to keep track a number of items:
- Who is attending
- Who is leading the meeting
- Who has yet to speak
- Who has spoken
 
## Installation
 
Here is how you get started tracking who you can pass it to next.
 
1. Place all of the files in a single folder. 
2. To customize the list of names displayed or to change the GUI settings, edit the constants.py file.
3. Run the standupTracker.py file with Python. 
 
## Usage
 
The list of employees to be displayed can be changed in the constants.py file. Currently, the window will accomodate up to 16 employees.
